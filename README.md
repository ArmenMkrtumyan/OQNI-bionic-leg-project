<h1 align="center">Data logger for Bionic Leg</h1>

This project aims to develop a bionic leg prototype that incorporates advanced sensor technology and data analysis capabilities. The Python code provided in this repository creates a data logger with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The GUI allows users to retrieve data from sensors, draw customizable graphs, and gain insights into the collected data.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Sensor data retrieval and analysis
- Customizable graphing capabilities
- Data insights and analysis tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArmenMkrtumyan/OQNI-bionic-leg-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd OQNI-bionic-leg-project
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```Jupyter Notebook
open .ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook
```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, the GUI window will appear, providing you with various options and features for data logging, graphing, and data analysis.
