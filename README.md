<h1 align="center">Data logger for Bionic Leg</h1>

This project aims to develop a bionic leg prototype that incorporates advanced sensor technology and data analysis capabilities. The Python code provided in this repository creates a data logger with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The GUI allows users to retrieve data from sensors, draw customizable graphs, and gain insights into the collected data.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Sensor data retrieval and analysis
- Customizable graphing capabilities
- Data insights and analysis tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bionic-leg.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd bionic-leg
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, the GUI window will appear, providing you with various options and features for data logging, graphing, and data analysis.

### Data Logging

1. Connect the sensors to the appropriate ports or interfaces.
2. Configure the sensor settings, such as sampling rate or data type.
3. Click on the "Start Logging" button to initiate data collection.
4. The collected data will be displayed and stored for further analysis.

### Graphing Data

1. Click on the "Graphs" tab in the navigation bar.
2. Select the desired graph type from the available options (e.g., line graph, bar chart, scatter plot).
3. Choose the data source from the collected data.
4. Customize the graph appearance by adjusting parameters and applying styling options.
5. Click on the "Generate Graph" button to create the graph.

### Data Insights and Analysis

The application provides various tools to gain insights and analyze the collected data. Some of the available features include:

- Statistical analysis: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- Data filtering and preprocessing options
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Comparative analysis between different data sets
- Exporting and sharing data and analysis results

Explore the application's GUI to discover additional tools and features.
